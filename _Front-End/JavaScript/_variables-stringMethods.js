// * Let * //
// Let - replaces the pre-ES6 variable declaration of 'var'. Let creates a mutable variable. It adheres to block-scope when created with a 'block'.
// The standard naming convention is camelCase.
let human = "Jacob"
let currentAge = 38
let isAlive = true

// * Const * //
// Const - short for constant. Ideally, we want to use constants for 'variables' unless we know we need a mutable variable.
// The standard naming convention for a constant is all uppercase and words separated by an underscore, as seen below:
const PERSON_NAME = "Jacob"
const GENDER = "Male"
const BIRTH_Place = "Toronto, Canada"
const IS_MARRIED = true

// * Comparison Operators * //
// In JS we have our standard comparison operators to test TRUE or FALSE.
// Less than < , greater than > , loosely equal == , strictly equal === , less than or equal <= , greater than or equal >= , loosely not equal to != , strictly not equal to !== (! + = [single or double equals] is how we actually type the loosely or strictly NOT equal to)
// ? Note: due to ligature fonts being installed these fonts may appear differently on other machines, terminals or windows.

// * Logical Operators * //
// Like comparison operators, logical operators are used to test whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE. They are used to determine logic between variables or values.
// "AND" && (two-ampersands) - if (condition X && condition Y) {}
// "OR" || (two-'pipes') - if (condition X || condition Y) {}
